## Introduction
Welcome to **colocar**! This repository houses a number of React.js- and p5.js-based tools for sparse annotations of three-dimensional (primarily spatial) datasets and complementary tools for validation of those sparse annotations.

These are primarily used through deployment to Amazon Web Services (AWS), but they can also be run locally with ease. In either case, they require access to a spatial database that houses the data to be annotated and a document-oriented database to receive the annotations. In particular, the current production workflow pulls imagery from [the Boss](https://github.com/jhuapl-boss/boss) and pushes annotations to [colocard](https://github.com/aplbrain/colocard).

## Setup
### Preamble: colocorazon
First, one must build the shared libraries, found in colocorazon. This can be done by cd-ing into colocorazon and running `yarn && yarn build`. This will transpile the shared libraries into browser-friendly, old-timey JavaScript.

### Amble: installing dependencies
Next, the apps require pulling modules into their node_modules. At present, this can be done by cd-ing into the app directory and running `yarn`.

### Postamble: with your powers combined!
Finally, with all dependencies built and installed, we are ready to run and deploy our apps.
